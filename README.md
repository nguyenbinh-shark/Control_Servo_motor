# ATmega16 Servo Control Project

## Project Overview
This project involves using an ATmega16 microcontroller to control a 2-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) mechanism, which simulates a camera mount. Instead of a camera, a DC motor is attached to the mount. The system provides the following functionalities:

- **Servo Control:** Two servo motors are used to control the pitch and yaw of the 2DOF mechanism. The servo angles range from -45째 to 45째.
- **DC Motor Speed Control:** The speed of the DC motor, attached to the mount, is controlled via PWM signals.
- **LCD Display:** A 16x2 LCD displays the current speed of the DC motor and the positions of the two servos.

## Features
- **Precise Angular Control:** Both servos are programmed for precise angular movement between -45째 and 45째.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** The system continuously updates and displays motor speed and servo positions on the LCD.
- **Flexible PWM Settings:** DC motor speed is adjustable using PWM signals generated by the ATmega16.

## Components
- **Microcontroller:** ATmega16
- **Servo Motors:** 2x Standard servo motors
- **DC Motor:** A small DC motor to simulate camera rotation
- **LCD Display:** 16x2 LCD
- **Power Supply:** Suitable power supply for the ATmega16, servo motors, and DC motor
- **Resistors and Capacitors:** For stability and pull-up configurations
- **Crystal Oscillator:** For ATmega16 clocking

## Circuit Design
1. **Servo Connections:**
   - Servo 1 (Pitch): Connected to PWM pin OC1A (Timer1 Channel A)
   - Servo 2 (Yaw): Connected to PWM pin OC1B (Timer1 Channel B)
2. **DC Motor Control:**
   - Controlled via PWM output pin (e.g., OC2 for Timer2)
3. **LCD Connections:**
   - Data pins connected to PORTC
   - Control pins (RS, RW, EN) connected to PORTD
4. **Power:**
   - Ensure a stable power supply for all components.
   - Decoupling capacitors are recommended near the ATmega16.

## Software Implementation
The project is implemented in C using Atmel Studio. Key aspects include:

- **Servo Control:**
  ```c
  OCR1A = map_angle_to_pwm(pitch_angle);
  OCR1B = map_angle_to_pwm(yaw_angle);
  ```
- **DC Motor Speed Control:**
  ```c
  OCR2 = map_speed_to_pwm(speed);
  ```
- **LCD Display Update:**
  ```c
  lcd_clear();
  lcd_printf("Speed: %d", motor_speed);
  lcd_printf("Pitch: %d", pitch_angle);
  lcd_printf("Yaw: %d", yaw_angle);
  ```

## Usage
1. Upload the firmware to the ATmega16 using a programmer.
2. Connect the components as per the circuit design.
3. Power the system and observe the LCD for real-time updates.
4. Adjust the speed and servo positions using the control interface.

## Future Improvements
- Add a user interface for dynamic control of servo angles and motor speed.
- Incorporate feedback sensors for more accurate position and speed control.
- Extend functionality to 3DOF by adding another servo.
